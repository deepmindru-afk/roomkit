"""Drive an AIChannel's tool loop and read what it produced.

An AIChannel runs one tool loop whatever its provider streams (RFC §6.4): a
provider that does not stream is read through its ``generate()``. A tool-loop
test takes the ``streaming`` fixture (``tests/conftest.py``) to run against
both kinds of provider, and drives the turn through the helpers below, which
read the loop's outcome into a :class:`LoopRun`:

- :func:`respond` goes through ``on_event``: pass the fixture's value to
  ``MockAIProvider(streaming=...)``. Under the fixture it checks that the
  provider streams in the mode the test runs in.
- :func:`run_tool_loop` runs the loop directly on a context.
