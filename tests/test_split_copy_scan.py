"""The scan for a copy of a runtime mark split over consecutive user messages,
read boundary by boundary (RFC §6.4; RMK-882).

A run of unanswered messages is read again by every turn, grown at its end or
slid at its head out of a memory's window: a boundary seen with no copy
across it is remembered by its window, so a turn scans its new boundaries
only, and a copy across any boundary is still cut."""
