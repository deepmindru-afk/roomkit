"""Phone numbers in one form, E.164, whatever the provider wrote.

Providers hand the same number over in different shapes — Twilio ``+15550000001``,
Twilio WhatsApp ``whatsapp:+15550000001``, Sinch ``15550000001``, a host typing
``(514) 555-0100`` — and a room is found by comparing the sender's number with
the one its binding names (RFC §10.4). Compared as strings, the same person
is a stranger to their own room. Every channel addressed by phone number
therefore reads numbers through :func:`normalize_phone_number`.

It never raises and needs no dependency: it runs on every inbound sender.
Validating a number a person typed is another job, done by
:func:`roomkit.providers.sms.normalize_phone` (the ``phonenumbers`` extra).
