"""The routed voice turn whose response the user has not heard yet (RFC §12.3.12).

A turn is routed, and until the first audio of its response reaches the
transport, nobody has heard it. A user who resumes speaking in that window is
still on their sentence: the response is held while they speak, then either
superseded by what they added or released to play as it would have.
