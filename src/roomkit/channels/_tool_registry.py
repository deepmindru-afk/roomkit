"""What a channel serves and what is installed on it, per room (RFC §19.7, §21.1).

One channel object serves every room it is attached to. The tools it serves
itself and the ones orchestration sets up on it are kept here, one entry per
tool: the definition the model reads, the function that serves a call, who set
it up, and the traits the channel's rules read (exempt from the policy, never
deferred by Tool Search, left out of the usage digest, pure within a turn).
An entry is the channel's for every room, or one room's: a strategy sets up a
room's tools, with that room's configuration, beside the other rooms' and
without touching them. A name is served by one tool in a room, so a second one
is refused when it is given.

The host's own tools stay the host's: its definitions and the handler it gave
serve every name no entry serves. The registry reads their names only, to
refuse an entry that would shadow one.

The tools orchestration sets up are the room owner's: the owner reads them
here for each turn it submits (:meth:`ChannelRegistry.owner_entries`) and
serves their calls (RFC §10.6.5). Inside a turn the turn backend runs, the
channel declares and calls the ones the request lists instead
(:class:`TurnOwnerTools`), so a channel an executor built elsewhere, whose
registry holds none of them, runs the same turn.

One more thing orchestration installs lives here rather than on the channel
object: the source a realtime channel reads a new session's configuration from
(a pipeline's active agent). Nothing is ever written onto the shared channel
for one room: a write made for one room would be read by every other room the
channel serves.
