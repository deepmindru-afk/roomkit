"""``run_skill_script`` as a tool a realtime channel serves (RFC §24).

An AI channel given ``skills=`` and a script executor declares and serves
``run_skill_script`` itself. A realtime voice channel whose skills belong to
another agent (a reasoning backend's) still has to run their scripts behind
its own execution gate: this tool, passed in its ``tools=``, runs them through
the one handler every channel uses.
