"""Per-turn channel configuration resolved by an application callback.

Channel config (system prompt, tools, sampling) is often dynamic in real
deployments — admin edits, per-user gating, feature flags. Snapshotting it
into the channel object or the binding metadata at attach time creates a
second source of truth that goes stale. ``AIChannel(config_provider=...)``
lets the application resolve the current config at the start of every turn
instead; binding-metadata overrides still win on top (they are explicit
per-room operator intent).
