"""RoomRecordingMixin — a room's media recordings, started, fed and stopped (RFC §12.11).

Recorders bound at ``create_room(recorders=...)`` start with the room; these
verbs start them on a room that already exists (a recording resumed after a
restart), list them, feed them a track the framework does not wire itself, and
stop them. Every start is announced (ON_RECORDING_STARTED, the consent point of
RFC §17.6) before any media, and every stop with its result
(ON_RECORDING_STOPPED), whichever path stops it.
