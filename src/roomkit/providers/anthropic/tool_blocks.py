"""The ``tool_use`` blocks of one streamed Anthropic response, folded into calls.

A block's call is announced when the block opens, its arguments stream as
deltas, and it is handed to the loop when the block closes. Every composition
event names the call by the id it ends with, and a call keeps that id and the
arguments that streamed even when the response ended before its block closed
(RFC §6.4).
