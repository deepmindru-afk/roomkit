    """Wraps a MemoryProvider and trims results to fit within a token budget.

    The history's budget is what is left of the window once everything else in
    it is paid for — see :func:`roomkit.memory.token_estimator.history_budget`,
    which owns the arithmetic. Read for an AI channel's turn, the rest of the
    turn is what the channel measured (:func:`current_turn_footprint`, RFC
    §20): its input is reserved, and its reply budget when larger than the
    safety margin. ``reserved_tokens`` is a floor on that input (system prompt,
    tool schemas, the channel's notes), for a caller that knows a part the
    channel cannot; it is not added to the measure. The injected ``messages``,
    the memory's notes and the current turn this wrapper passes through are
    measured here. A current turn that alone exceeds a known window raises a
    non-retryable ``ProviderError(context_overflow=True)`` before retrieval or
    generation: trimming history cannot make that message fit.

    Events are trimmed from the oldest, preserving the most recent conversation.

    The one way the result can still exceed the budget is ``min_events``: the
    most recent few events are kept even when they don't fit, because returning
    an empty history is worse than returning one that needs compaction.
