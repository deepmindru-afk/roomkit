"""The skills MCP servers serve, as a registry holds them (RFC §24.7).

The catalogue keeps, for each server a host registered, the host's label for
it and the entries it last gave; a :class:`~roomkit.skills.SkillRegistry`
keeps the names, the manifest and the skills loaded. Loading a skill reads its
``SKILL.md`` then, and not before, and checks it against the entry; reading
one of its files reads only a file the held entry lists, checked the same way.
What the model is told of a failure names the skill only: a server's text
reaches it as a skill's content or not at all.
