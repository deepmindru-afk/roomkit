"""The two ends of a turn carried by Redis (RFC §10.6.3, §10.6.8).

Each end numbers what it sends and admits what it receives in order, as on
any backend: the messages are the protocol's envelopes, posted to the other
process's inbox in the order they were numbered (one writer per destination),
and routed to the turn's link by its id there. A message Redis refuses breaks
its link: the turn fails at once instead of waiting for what will not come.
