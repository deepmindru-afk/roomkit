"""What reaches a process's inbox on the Redis turn backend, and where it goes.

Each kind of entry has its route: a frame to the owner's end of its turn, a
control message to the executor's, a request to the executor it names, a
channel control to that executor, an answer to the question waiting for it,
and the work a turn began after it ended to the room owner that submitted the
turn (RFC §10.6.3), whichever process that owner runs in. A request and a
channel control are answered, so the owner goes on only once the executor's
process took them, in order, as the in-memory backend does.

An entry can arrive twice: a client that runs a pipeline again when its
connection dropped after Redis executed it writes its entries twice. A
numbered message is admitted once by its turn's order; a question (a request,
a channel control, work after a turn) is handled once by its reference, and
asked again it is answered again.
