"""One turn on its room owner (RFC §10.6.4, §10.6.8).

The owner reads the turn's frames back into the objects the pipeline reads
locally: a ``ChannelOutput``, a stream whose reads grant the executor a
window of items, the turn's one response-metadata record updated in place as
the reader reaches the item it was sent before, and call markers whose
fixed arguments and early ends are set on the owner's own copies. The calls
the turn makes to its owner run here as they arrive (RFC §10.6.5), and the
owner steers the turn's loop (RFC §10.6.8). The turn is watched from its
submission to its end: an executor silent too long has lost the turn.
