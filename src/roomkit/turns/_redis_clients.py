"""The Redis connections a turn backend opens (RFC §10.6.8).

Each gives up a call on a peer gone without closing (a half-open connection:
a NAT or a load balancer forgot it) within half the backend's silence bound,
its inbox's blocking read the time the server holds it more, and the beat or
the read it cut is tried again at once on a new connection. While the
heartbeat interval stays under the other half of the silence bound (the
defaults: 2 s and 10 s), that try lands inside the silence bound: a process is
never taken for lost for one dead connection. redis-py before 8.0 sets no
bound of its own; 8.0 and later bound every call at 5 s.
