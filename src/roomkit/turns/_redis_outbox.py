"""What a process writes to the other processes' inboxes on the Redis turn backend.

Each destination has one writer task: what is posted to a node reaches its
inbox in the order it was posted, a batch per round trip, whatever task posted
it and whether that task is cancelled meanwhile. Posting never waits, so a
message is numbered and queued in one step, and two messages of one turn can
never reach the other side in the other order (RFC §10.6.3). A message of a
batch Redis refuses is written again a moment later, before what was posted
after it, when it may be (an answer, work after a turn, written until they
are); one that may not (a turn's message, whose order its turn counts) is
not, and its sender is told: its turn fails rather than wait for what will
not come. A
writer left idle goes, and the next message to its node starts another;
closing writes what is queued (a turn's ``end`` among it) within a bound, and
tells the senders of the rest.
