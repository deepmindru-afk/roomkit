class Transcript:
    """The text of one realtime session, as RoomKit results.

    Each ``transcription.text.delta`` adds text after the text already sent,
    final as it arrives and carrying its own spaces, so a partial is the text
    so far. Without turn detection the session is one utterance, and
    ``transcription.done`` gives its text of record.

    With turn detection the text is cut into turns. ``turn.start`` opens one
    (a speech start) and ``turn.end`` sets :attr:`closing`; the caller then
    calls :meth:`close` once the turn's last words have had time to arrive.
    The turn events come at once while the text runs a streaming delay
    behind the audio, so a turn's last words can follow its ``turn.end`` by
    nearly that delay, and even the next ``turn.start`` (measured 2026-10-21:
    "Italy?" arrived after the next turn had started). The text that comes
    before :meth:`close` is the ending turn's; a ``turn.start`` meanwhile is
    a speech start, its turn opening at the close, and the close comes a
    little sooner, ``next_turn_wait_s`` after the end: that turn's own words
    come at least a delay after the end. Text that arrives after its turn's
    final belongs to a turn already given: it is counted in
    :attr:`late_chars`, never sent as a turn of its own.

    Args:
        turns: Whether the session detects turns.
        final_wait_s: How long a turn waits after ``turn.end`` for its last words.
        next_turn_wait_s: How long it waits after ``turn.end`` once the next
