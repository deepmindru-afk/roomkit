class VoxtralSTTConfig:
    """Configuration for :class:`VoxtralSTTProvider`.

    Attributes:
        api_key: Mistral API key (sent as ``Bearer``).
        model: File transcription model: ``voxtral-mini-transcribe-3``, or
            ``voxtral-small-transcribe-3`` for the most accurate.
        realtime_model: Realtime transcription model.
        language: Language to transcribe, as a BCP-47 tag or an ISO 639-1
            code (``"fr-CA"`` is sent as ``"fr"``). ``None`` lets the model
            detect it.
        context_bias: Names and terms the model should spell right (a
            product, a person, a place), phrases included.
        streaming_delay_ms: How long the realtime model listens past a word
            before writing it: shorter is sooner, longer is more accurate.
            Any value from 80 to 1200, or 2400.
        turn_detection: The realtime model's turn detection, for a channel
            without a pipeline VAD; ``None`` behind one, where a turn ended
            inside an utterance would otherwise be lost (see the module
            docstring).
        final_wait_ms: How long a turn's final waits after the model ends the
            turn, for its last words, which the text brings up to a streaming
            delay later. ``None`` is the delay plus 100 ms (0.58 s with the
            defaults). Words later than it are dropped, with a warning.
        diarize: Label who spoke: every final names its speaker, in
            ``segments``. Live it excludes ``turn_detection``, which must then
            be ``None``.
        speaker_references: A short recording of each known voice (WAV, MP3,
            FLAC or Opus bytes, 3 to 15 s of mostly speech) by the name its
            segments then carry; at most 8. Live only: the file endpoint took
            them and kept its own labels (measured 2026-10-21). Requires
            ``diarize``.
        diarized_pause_ms: How long without new words ends a diarized turn
            live (no turn events then). One person's words came up to 2 s
            apart, a new speaker's 1.5 s after the last (measured 2026-10-21).
        base_url: API root, without a version.
        realtime_url: Realtime WebSocket endpoint; ``None`` derives it from
            ``base_url``.
        timeout: Read budget of a file transcription, in seconds.
        connect_timeout: TCP connect budget, in seconds, apart from ``timeout``.
        handshake_timeout_s: How long a stream waits, in all, for the
            connection and for the session to accept its settings.
        final_timeout_s: How long a stream waits, once its audio has ended,
            for the end of the transcript.
