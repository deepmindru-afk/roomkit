"""What each turn of a discussion knows: the room and how it works (RFC §19.7.5 rule 14).

The notes join the turn's input as the runtime's own block. What they hold of
the room comes in a form nobody can turn into the runtime's words: agents'
handles, and the names people are addressed by, kept to a name's characters (no
space, no punctuation but ``_ . -``) and bounded. Everything else a
participant controls is quoted, on one line, between marks it cannot close
(``roomkit._text.quoted``): the label an author carries in the transcript
(``Alice (2)`` for a second source that takes Alice's name) and what they
wrote. An Agent's name, role and description are the host's, and so are
the rules a discussion gives in place of the default.
