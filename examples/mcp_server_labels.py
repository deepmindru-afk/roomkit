"""RoomKit -- a tool policy that names one MCP server, with two servers composed.

Two MCP servers both serve ``delete_records``. A model that names MCP tools the
way prompts written for Claude Code do calls ``mcp__<server>__<tool>``. Each
provider is given ``label=``, the host's name for its server: its tool handler
serves only the aliases naming that server, so the alias reaches the server it
names whatever the order of the chain (RFC §21.2).

A policy judges an alias under both its names. To keep a server out, deny its
aliases (``deny=["mcp__archive__*"]``); to admit one server only, allow its
aliases and its tools' names (``allow=["mcp__crm__*", "delete_records"]``).
Such a policy holds only when the session declares the tools under their
aliases alone, as here: a bare ``delete_records`` names no server, so it is
refused as undeclared. Declared under their bare names, a bare call runs on
the first server of the chain that has the tool, the archive here, whatever
the policy says of servers; a host that declares bare names puts first the
server its bare names must reach. A provider without ``label=`` serves an alias
whatever server it names: a policy that names a server cannot hold a call to it.

    RealtimeVoiceChannel (tools=the aliases, tool_policy=deny mcp__archive__*)
        └── compose_tool_handlers
              ├── MCPToolProvider(label="archive") ── stdio ── records_server.py archive
              └── MCPToolProvider(label="crm")     ── stdio ── records_server.py crm

Runs on the mock realtime provider, so it needs no API key: the model's tool
calls are simulated.

Requirements:
    pip install roomkit[mcp]

Run:
    uv run python examples/mcp_server_labels.py
