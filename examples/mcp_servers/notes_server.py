"""A tiny MCP server over stdio, for examples/mcp_stdio_tools.py, mcp_read_resource.py
and acp_room_mcp.py.

Keeps notes in memory for as long as it runs. Any MCP server started as a
command works the same way; this one only needs the ``mcp`` package. Started
with ``NOTES_ROOM`` in its environment, it files its notes under that room.
