"""Per-call tool context — which room, and whose turn.

A tool handler receives only ``(name, arguments)``. Everything else it might
close over at construction time — a room, a user, a database handle scoped to
one person — describes whoever attached the channel, because one ``AIChannel``
object is registered per ``channel_id`` and shared by every room and every
speaker it serves.

``roomkit.tools`` exposes the turn instead, through a contextvar the tool loop
sets:

- ``current_tool_room_id()``      — the room this turn belongs to
- ``current_tool_room()``         — the ``Room`` itself, as the turn loaded it
- ``current_tool_actor_id()``     — whose turn it is
- ``current_tool_allowed_names()`` — the toolset the turn resolved, less what
  its tool policy denies

This example puts two people in one room, both talking to the same agent, and
shows the handler answering each of them correctly — including refusing, twice,
because the actor is not something to trust on sight:

1. Alice is an identified member: the tool resolves her to an identity and
   answers with her rows.
2. Bob is on the roster but never identified: the id reads back just fine, so
   the handler has to check ``identification`` itself and refuse.
3. A system injection has no author at all: ``None``, and the tool refuses
   rather than borrowing whoever spoke last.
4. The same handler, called from a realtime voice session: the realtime
   channel installs the same context around the call, so Alice's voice turn
   is answered like her text turn.
5. The same handler, called directly as a unit test would: no channel runs,
   ``tool_turn_context`` describes Alice's turn around the call and takes it
   away when the block exits.
