"""Go on when a model announces an action and stops: an AI channel's continuation policy.

A model answers "I will check the run." and stops, without calling the tool it
announced. The channel's continuation policy recognizes the announcement and
hands the model an instruction to go on; the next round calls the tool and
answers. Shows:
- AIChannel(continuation=...): the text of a round the model ended itself,
  without a call, in; the instruction to go on, or None, out
- The same signal on every provider: "stop", "end_turn" and "STOP" alike
- The bound it shares with the empty round (max_empty_retries), and the
  ``unfinished`` end of a turn whose policy still asks once it has run out

Run with:
    uv run python examples/ai_continuation_policy.py
