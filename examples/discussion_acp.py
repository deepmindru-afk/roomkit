"""Claude Code takes part in a discussion, over ACP (RFC §6.4, §19.7.5).

@dev is Claude Code, an external agent, in the same discussion as @sre, an
AI channel: it takes its turns like any agent, reads the discussion's notes,
and works in a read-only workspace holding a checkout service's source and
its support tickets. The run:

1. The on-call asks @dev why Canadian checkouts fail: Claude Code reads the
   source and answers in its turn.
2. The on-call starts a task for @dev with ``kit.start_task`` (the tickets,
   a longer read): it runs in a session of its own, in a child room, while
   @sre answers a quick question; the findings are posted as @dev's message
   when they are done (``hand_back="post"``).

``--console`` opens the discussion console instead, to lead the room
yourself (``/task @dev ...`` starts a task, ``/tasks`` lists them).

Requires:
    pip install "roomkit[acp,console]"
    Node.js 22+ with ``npx``, and Claude Code signed in once:
    npx -y @agentclientprotocol/claude-agent-acp@0.61.0 --cli auth login --claudeai

Run with:
    uv run python examples/discussion_acp.py
    uv run python examples/discussion_acp.py --console
