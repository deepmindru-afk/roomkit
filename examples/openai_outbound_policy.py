"""An outbound policy on an OpenAI-compatible provider, through ``transport=``.

A host that lets its users name an OpenAI-compatible endpoint (a self-hosted
model, a gateway) must not let that URL reach its own network: a cloud
metadata address, a loopback service. The policy belongs where the address is
dialled, so it judges every request, redirects included. Shows:
- OpenAIAIProvider(config, transport=...): every request of the SDK goes
  through the transport, inside the SDK's own default client
- a transport wrapper that refuses a private address before a byte leaves
- the same seam on AzureAIProvider, OpenRouterAIProvider, create_vllm_provider
- the same transport on the clients that draw or look: OpenAIImageProvider
  here, and the Azure, xAI and Meta image providers and OpenAIVisionProvider

Runs without a key: a MockTransport stands in for the endpoint.

Run with:
    uv run python examples/openai_outbound_policy.py
